> "_I find that Laura has extensive knowledge of NVC and knows how to transfer her knowledge in a clear and structured way. I sense, in the way she facilitates her NVC workshops, that she has a lot of practical experience with NVC and I am impressed by the confident, inspiring and passionate way she shares those skills with me and the other participants. I feel that, apart of being a great NVC teacher, she walks her talk and for her NVC is a way of Being, a way of Living. Thanks to her input I have been able to deepen my self understanding and the understanding of others and improve my handling of conflicts between me and others and improve my mediation skills in conflicts between others. I love her._” – Feedback from friend in Auroville, Nov 2010

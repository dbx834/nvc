# Mediation & Facilitation

We offer mediation and facilitated conversations for those seeking support to dialogue with a friend, colleague or family member.

We also offer group facilitation for groups seeking support with team dynamics, or to reconnect with the group’s purpose and to clarify next steps for forward movement.

We hold space based primarily on the principles of Nonviolent Communication. And in addition, we may use practices from [Sociocracy](http://www.sociocracy.info/) (shared-power governance) and [Internal Family Systems](https://selfleadership.org/) (uncovering our inner parts), both of which complement NVC very beautifully.

If you live in Auroville, you may also [call a Restorative Circle](/call-a-circle), which is a community process for working through conflict and misunderstanding.

# Sociocracy

Sociocracy is a collaborative governance method based on effective organization, distributed authority, and inclusive decision-making. It creates a deeper democracy at all levels of an organization or business.

The Sociocratic Circle-Organization Method (SCM) was developed in the Netherlands by electrical engineer and entrepreneur Gerard Endenburg and is based on the work of peace activists and educators Betty Cadbury and Kees Boeke and is a recent instantiation of the approach.

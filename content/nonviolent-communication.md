> "_All that has been integrated into NVC has been known for centuries about consciousness, language, communication skills, and use of power that enable us to maintain a perspective of empathy for ourselves and others, even under trying conditions._" – Marshall B. Rosenberg, Phd

Nonviolent Communication contains nothing new. It is based on historical principles of nonviolence – the natural state of compassion when no violence is present in the heart. NVC reminds us what we already instinctively know about how good it feels to authentically connect to another human being.

With NVC we learn to hear our own deeper needs and those of others. Through its emphasis on deep listening to ourselves as well as others NVC helps us discover the depth of our own compassion. This language reveals the awareness that all human beings are only trying to honor universal values and needs, every minute, every day.

NVC can be seen as both a spiritual practice that helps us see our common humanity, using our power in a way that honors everyone’s needs, and a concrete set of skills which help us create life-serving families and communities.

The form is simple, yet powerfully transformative.

Through the practice of NVC, we can learn to clarify what we are observing, what emotions we are feeling, what values we want to live by, and what we want to ask of ourselves and others. We will no longer need to use the language of blame, judgment or domination. We can experience the deep pleasure of contributing to each other’s well being.

NVC creates a path for healing and reconciliation in its many applications, ranging from intimate relationships, work settings, health care, social services, police, prison staff and inmates, to governments, schools and social change organizations.

> "_I want to say thank you yet again! I was giving and receiving feedback with a colleague who I much respect, when she shared with me that she sees me as an example of living NVC -- being able to accept each person for what s/he is and yet not mincing my words in stating what my truth is. I so cherished this feedback and went back to the journey I have been on with you. And then your face and way of being flashed in front of me. Thank you for all you have done and all that you are -- grounded, free flowing, demanding, accepting, caring, patient, happy, unhappy, an expert, a learner, and SUPER FUN!_" – Participant from NVC Leadership Program, 2014

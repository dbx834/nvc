abstract: The Internal Family Systems (IFS) has evolved over the past twenty years into a comprehensive approach that includes guidelines for working with individuals, couples, and families. The IFS Model represents a new synthesis of two already-existing paradigms - systems thinking and the multiplicity of the mind. It brings concepts and methods from the structural, strategic, narrative, and Bowenian schools of family therapy.

> “_Conflict is not a problem that needs solving, but a phenomenon that needs understanding._” – Dominic Barter

<br />

> “_I don't want to resolve conflict any more. I want conflict to happen. I don't want to fight reality. Conflict as I understand it is part of living together. It's part of our social coexistence. I don't know if going up the mountain and going into a cave will get you away from conflict, but it's not my choice of how to live. I'm interested in working out and understanding at a deeper level what actually happens when conflict occurs. And how can I effectively engage with it._” – Dominic Barter

A Restorative Circle is a community process designed to hold space for those in conflict. It brings together the three parties in a conflict – those who acted, those directly impacted, and the wider community – within an intentional systemic context, to dialogue as equals. Participants invite each other and attend voluntarily. The dialogue process used is shared openly with all participants, and facilitated by a community member. The process ends when actions have been found that bring mutual benefit and nurture the inherent integrity of all those involved in the conflict.

Restorative Circles are facilitated in 3 stages, and are designed to identify the key factors in the conflict, reach agreements on next steps, and evaluate the results. As Circles form, they invite shared power, mutual understanding, self-responsibility and effective action within the community.

> “_When sitting down to a conflict is like sitting down to a meal then the community has developed a resilience on which culture can build._” – Dominic Barter

Restorative Circles are a specific restorative practice whose development began with the work of Dominic Barker in the favelas in Rio de Janeiro in the mid 1990s and continues with a growing community both in Brazil and internationally.

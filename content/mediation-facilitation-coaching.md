# Mediation / Facilitation / Coaching

We hold space based primarily on the principles of Nonviolent Communication. And in addition, we may use practices from [Sociocracy](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Sociocracy) (shared-power governance) and [Internal Family Systems](https://selfleadership.org/) (uncovering our inner parts), both of which complement NVC beautifully.

## Mediation

We offer mediation and facilitated conversations for those seeking support to dialogue with a friend, colleague or family member.

> _"L'aura has the gift of unveiling our real essence: translating our wounded expression into its true message of care, love and peace for ourselves and for others! I experienced a miracle, the unfolding of a new consciousness, the transformation of an inextricable conflict to a peaceful understanding of our differences and concrete steps forward to care for each other. I was moved by L’aura’s ability to catch our hidden needs. I can’t see a more beautiful and authentic way to connect and walk towards peace."_ – Testimonial by Michelle, a party in a mediation

## Group Facilitation

We offer group facilitation for groups seeking support with team dynamics, or to reconnect with the group’s purpose and to clarify next steps for forward movement.

## Individual Coaching

We offer individual coaching for those seeking support to work through challenges, to gain more self-understanding, and to access one’s own capacity to shift into a dynamic that feels more life-serving.

## Call a Circle

If you live in Auroville, you may also [call a Restorative Circle](/call-a-circle), which is a community process for working through conflict and misunderstanding.

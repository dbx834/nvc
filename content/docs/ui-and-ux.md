# How We Do UI

In essence we use [React](https://reactjs.org/) to manage user interfaces.

## Component Libraries Used

&nbsp; 1. [AntD](https://ant.design/docs/react/introduce) is a React UI library with a set of high quality components. We use this everywhere!

&nbsp; 2. Our own [components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bodhi-project/components) library, which is a collection of React elements that we use everywhere. Documentation for this does not exist but is on it's way.

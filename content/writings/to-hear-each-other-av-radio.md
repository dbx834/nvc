# To Hear Each Other - AV Radio

Today’s General Meeting will be still at SAWCHU at 5pm, and Resident Assembly Service does expect us to come, to share, to be constructive, to be loving to each other…to create unity in order to build the city of dawn. In today’s news we feature an interesting excerpt from the presentation of Resorative Circle which happened last week and full recordings will be published soon on our page. A Restorative Circle is a community process for supporting those in conflict. It brings together parties of a conflict to “hear” each other.

> "_O Lord, I pray to Thee, guide my footsteps, enlighten my mind, that at every moment and in all things I may do exactly what Thou wantest me to do._" – The Mother, 16 January 1962

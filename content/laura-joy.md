# L’aura Joy

L’aura Joy is a Certified Trainer in Nonviolent Communication (CNVC, USA), and over the past 10 years she has been been working in the field of communication, conflict transformation, peace and justice, community building and healing, decision-making and leadership.

Having grown up in Auroville, an international intentional community in Tamil Nadu, L'aura is passionate about exploring how we can live our lives in empowered and co-creative ways. Nonviolent Communication offers such a clear, yet deeply powerful and transformative framework within which to explore both our inner realities as well as outer relationships. In addition to NVC, L'aura is also trained in Restorative Circles and Sociocracy, and she applies these approaches to her work with justice and governance in Auroville.

L’aura has traveled and shared in different countries and contexts, ranging from the corporate sector, to schools, to NGOs working with women and street kid, exploring NVC as a means to transformation and sustainable change. Most of her work has been in India, although she has also worked in Canada, UK, Switzerland, USA, Sri Lanka and Nepal.

L'aura has been a pioneer in bringing NVC to India and has supported an ever-growing community to emerge. She has hosted and organized events for several international trainers here, she has published NVC books and teaching material, and she has offered her own training programs.

At the beginning of her career, L'aura was a high-school teacher, and she taught in both Canada and Auroville. Her main subjects were English and French as second languages, plus introductory courses to Sociology, Anthropology and Psychology. She specialized in the International Baccalaureate Program (an internationally accredited program) and taught senior IB students. She organized several extra-curricular programs for the students, including international travel programs, cultural outings, camping and trekking trips, and cross-country running.

L'aura's personal interests lie in making deep connections with people, living a meaningful and sustainable life, contributing to community, and practicing yoga and being physically active.
